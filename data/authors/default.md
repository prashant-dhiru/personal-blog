Hi all, I'm Prashant Dhirendra, currently working as a software designer in Eden-Net (Nokia's Self Organizing Network solution for telecom)

My day to day works involve in feature enchantment, debugging and bug-fixing for [Cell Outage Detection and Cell Outage Compensation Module](https://www.slideshare.net/3G4GLtd/3gpp-son-series-cell-outage-detection-and-compensation-cod-coc) in Eden-Net.

I have keen interest in learning new web and database technologies, cyber security and writing manageable clean code which can be later extended without hours of debugging for going through the tons of documentation.

I have completed my Master in Computer Application from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2021 with 9.32 CGPA, where I was part of a project to develope [novel technique to grade subjective answers using Word2Vec](https://github.com/prashant-dhiru/Novel-Technique-to-Grade-Subjective-Answers) neural network data model.
